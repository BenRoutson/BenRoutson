### Senior web developer with 8+ years of experience in React, Ruby.
####   Senior web developer with a passion for building creative, responsive, web applications. Experience in building robust web applications using Ruby on Rails/PostgreSQL or MongoDB/Node/Express on the backend, and React and Redux on the frontend. Recently I created a pixel-perfect clone of Spotify, complete with a custom Postgres database, user authentication, playlist CRUD, live search, and seamless playback (link below).
####   Had a passion for computers and mathematics since I was a small child, it was a natural next step for me to study physics/computer science during my time in university. An internship involving creating a website sparked my interest in web development and took the steps on a lifelong journey of learning new technologies and honing my skills as a developer.
####   Also, experience in database analysis, identifying and solving complex support issues. Skills in team-building, organization, analysis, and research, and management.
